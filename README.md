## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

My motivation for this project is two-fold. First, I want to apply my data-science skills to COVID-19 analysis. Secondly, to meet my requirements towards attaining a Udacity nano-degree in Data Science. I came up with threequestion I wanted to answer from the dataset. 

The questions of concern are related to the ability to respond and control the spread of the pandemic. The questions are:
Which countries had the best & worst performances in delaying the onset of transmission?
Which countries have reached the peak and past it, and which ones did that first?
Which countries have had a re-surge in cases after an initial control?
